# 🏦 Java Bank Account Simulation

Welcome to my **Java Bank Account Simulation**, built as part of my internship at **Elevate Labs**.  
This project simulates basic banking operations like deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history using a user-driven console menu.

---

## 📌 Description

This is a **menu-based banking application** created in **Java**, designed to run in the console.  
It allows the user to create a bank account and perform common operations such as:
- Checking balance
- Depositing money
- Withdrawing money (with insufficient funds check)
- Viewing transaction history  

The project was built using **IntelliJ IDEA** as the development environment.
